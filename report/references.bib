abstract="At universities, some fields of study offer multiple branches to graduate in. These branches are defined by mandatory and optional courses. Configuring a branch manually can be a difficult task, especially if some courses have already been attended. Hence, a tool providing guidance on choosing courses is desired. Feature models enable modelling such behaviour, as they are designed to define valid configurations from a set of features. Unfortunately, the branches contain constraints instructing to choose at least k out of n courses in essence. Encoding some of these constraints na{\"i}vely in propositional calculus is practically infeasible. We develop a new encoding by combining existing approaches. Furthermore, we report on our experience of encoding the constraints of the computer science master at TU Braunschweig and discuss the impact for research on configurability.",

abstract="We consider the problem of encoding Boolean cardinality constraints in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Boolean cardinality constraints are formulae expressing that at most (resp. at least) k out of n propositional variables are true. We give two novel encodings that improve upon existing results, one which requires only 7n clauses and 2n auxiliary variables, and another one demanding {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(n {\backslash}cdot k){\$}clauses, but with the advantage that inconsistencies can be detected in linear time by unit propagation alone. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on the number of required clauses for any such encoding.",
